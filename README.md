This project aims to classify sports personalities into five categories: Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Virat Kohli, Roger Federer, and Lionel Messi. It utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize and classify faces.

### Folder Structure

- **UI**: Contains the code for the user interface website.
- **server**: Python Flask server for handling HTTP requests and responses.
- **model**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for model building and training.
- **google_image_scrapping**: Code for scraping Google for images of sports personalities.
- **images_dataset**: Dataset used for training the models.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language used throughout the project.
- **Numpy and OpenCV**: Utilized for data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Employed for data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn (Sklearn)**: Used for building and training machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm**: IDEs used for development.
- **Python Flask**: Framework used for HTTP server implementation.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Technologies used for building the user interface.
- **AWS EC2 Instance**: Deployed on AWS for hosting the application.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `model` directory and run the Jupyter notebooks to train the machine learning models.
3. Once models are trained, start the Flask server located in the `server` directory.
4. Open the UI website located in the `UI` directory in a web browser.
5. Upload an image containing one of the sports personalities listed above to see the classification results.
